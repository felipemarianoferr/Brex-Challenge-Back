The spend pattern is highly correlated month‑to‑month and the same engineering team purchases both services. Consolidating to a single cloud provider would allow the company to negotiate volume discounts, reduce duplicate tooling/ops overhead, and simplify governance.",

        "reasoning": "Both vendors provide comparable large‑language‑model APIs (GPT‑4‑style vs Claude).

A single‑vendor strategy would enable a higher‑volume pricing tier and reduce integration maintenance.",

        "reasoning": "Both tools are used by the Design team for similar purposes (creating UI mock‑ups, marketing assets, etc.). Maintaining two separate licenses creates redundant capability. Consolidating to the lower‑cost tool (Figma) or negotiating an enterprise bundle can capture a 20% cost reduction while preserving needed functionality.",
        "recommendation": "Standardize on Figma (the cheaper option) and discontinue the Canva subscription, renegotiating the Figma contract for a 20% enterprise discount."
      }
    ],
    "summary": "The analysis uncovered three primary areas of duplicate spend: cloud infrastructure (AWS vs. GCP), generative AI APIs (OpenAI vs. Anthropic), and design tools (Figma vs. Canva). Consolidating each pair could save roughly $17.6k, $7.0k, and $0.43k per year respectively, representing 20%, 15% and 20% reductions in those spend categories. Implementing these consolidations would streamline vendor management, reduce operational overhead, and improve negotiating leverage, delivering an estimated total annual savings of about $25,052 across the organization."
